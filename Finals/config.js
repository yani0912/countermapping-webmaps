    para1: 'Initiated in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Belt And Road Initiative (BRI) is a massive global infrastructure development project envisioning a China-centered global trading network involving more than 60% of the world population. While the mainstream narratives focus on discussing China’s ambitious expansion and the response of the West or the geopolitical earthquake and a promising economic boost for the third world countries, seldom do the discourse voices for the marginalized citizens of these countries when most of them are under politically unstable status, in debt or undergo a severe corruption problem.',
    para2: 'The project situates BRI at four different scales 1) Global Scale 2) China-Indochina Pennisula Corridor 3) China-Laos Borderland 4) Boten Special Economic Zone to call for people’s attention to the impact of a massive global infrastructure project on the livelihood of underrepresented individuals’ from third-world countries. Spectators are expected to think about what is visible and what is invisiblized at each scale.',

            //image: 'images/source.png',
            description: 'China’s approach to speed up BRI’s progress is by offering loans to politically unstable and less-democratic countries with loose restrictions and much flexibility. When under fiscal crisis, those countries will be in debt with China. Therefore, China can take over land ownership and other rights of use of their local resources and assets naturally without the consent from the local residents, which is called the “Debt-trap Diplomacy”. For example, China handed out short-term loans to Sri Lanka to build a major port at Hambantota when the country was caught in a financial crisis, which allowed China to seize the right of use of this port by the Chinese Navy for ninety-nine years. Some countries can also fall into “debt distress” with China, such as Djibouti’s debt to China amounts to 70% of its GDP. <br> China’s ignoring of proper project management and tolerance of corruption also makes it harder for other loan lenders like World Bank, Asia Development Bank, etc. to interfere with their standardized environmental and social impact assessment. <br> <br> The darker the countries are highlighted, the more indebt they are.<br> <br> Data: Total external debt stocks to gross national income',

Not only may the local residents be excluded from BRI capital flow, but the BRI development projects may kill local entrepreneurship and dispossess the villagers from their own lands. <br><br> Villages highted in red indicate a positive growth of labor working in non-farmer sections, while shades of blue indicaates a decrease. <br><br> Data: Change of Percentage of population with main activity non-farmer section (2009-2019)',
